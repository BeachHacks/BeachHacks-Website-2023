## Branch Naming Convention

Please follow the following naming convention when creating a new branch:

- `<name>__<branch-name>`

  - `<name>` - first name only
  - `<branch-name>` - notes that represent the work you did
    - replace whitespace as `-`
    - lower case is preferred

- Examples
  - `lydia__worked-on-FAQ`
  - `daniel__fixed-bugs`
